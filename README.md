# Computer simulation

Simulation of port operations, estimating waiting times for service depending on the intensity of port traffic. 
The program computes the waiting times for different watercraft types for a range of traffic intensity values.

## Configurable parameters
* minimal traffic intensity
* maximal traffic intensity
* intensity value step 
* number of simulation runs for each intensity value
